# Market Data API Observability Platform

An observability platform „ÖÅthat analyzes real-time performance metrics and traces of YFinance API requests. Built with OpenTelemetry for monitoring, Prometheus for data collection, and Grafana for the UI visualization layer - uses [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run each service in a Docker container.

## Features
- Get real-time stock data with YFinance
- Monitor system performance using OpenTelemetry through traces
- Collect metrics with Prometheus
- Visualize data through Grafana's UI layer
- FastAPI backend with built-in API docs

## todo
- [x] yfinance api expansion
  - [x] add historical data endpoints (/stock/{ticker}/historical)
  - [x] add company info/profile data (/stock/{ticker}/info)
  - [x] add dividend data (/stock/{ticker}/dividends)
  - [x] add options chain data (/stock/{ticker}/options)
  - [] add multiple symbol support (/stocks/batch)
- [ ] metrics to export
  - [ ] stock price fetch latency
  - [ ] successful vs failed yfinance calls
  - [ ] number of unique symbols requested
  - [ ] cache hit/miss ratio (if we add caching)
- [ ] traces to implement
  - [ ] full request lifecycle for each endpoint
  - [ ] yfinance api call duration
  - [ ] data processing time
  - [ ] symbol validation steps
- [ ] docker stuff
  - [ ] create dockerfile for fastapi service
  - [ ] set up docker-compose for local dev
  - [ ] production docker config
- [ ] prometheus setup
  - [ ] collect basic metrics (req/s, latency)
  - [ ] add yfinance-specific metrics
- [ ] grafana dashboards
  - [ ] stock data request performance
  - [ ] yfinance api usage patterns
  - [ ] endpoint usage heatmap
- [ ] opentelemetry implementation
  - [ ] add spans for api endpoints
  - [ ] configure exporters

## How It Works

- **Data Collection**: FastAPI grabs the data and tracks metrics
- **Metrics Storage**: Prometheus stores all the data
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry helps track system behavior
- **Visualization**: Grafana provides the UI layer for data visualization

## stuff you need to run this

- python 3.9 or newer
- docker desktop if you want to run containers
- that's pretty much it for now!
